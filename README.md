## About

This is a standalone Python application for Q-ary Huffman encoding and compression visualization.  
You can analyze text, compress it with variable Q-values, visualize the Huffman tree, and compare compression performance.

No Python installation is required — just double-click the `.exe`.

## How to Use

1. Launch `Huffman.exe` (no installation needed).
2. Enter your text or upload a file.
3. Choose a Q-value (e.g., 2 for binary, 3 for ternary).

5. View:
   - Symbol frequencies
   - Huffman tree visualization
   - Compression metrics
6. Export results using buttons:
   - Encoded text
   - Standalone decoder
   - Full package with metrics and JSON
